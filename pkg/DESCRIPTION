Description: This package facilitates taking movement data in xyt format and pairing it with raster covariates within a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) framework.  As described in Hanks et al. (2015), this allows flexible modeling of movement in response to covariates (or covariate gradients) with model fitting possible within a Poisson GLM framework.
